# Spinboy
A simple (I hope) 2D platformer in unity with the core mechanic being spinning to clear enemies and obstacles in a short 15 level (+ 3 bonus levels) game.

Go through each level to complete the game and collect the secret coin in each level to unlock a bonus.

Working on this with some other fucknuts to keep me in line so if I dont get this done something is seriously wrong.
